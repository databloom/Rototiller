Rototiller is a series of shell script that wrap GoogleScraper and wget to download files from the internet.

Tiller.sh populates an index for wget, and files are dropped into a repo folder.

Next iterations of the tool will allow you to construct home directory working sets for users with real files for compression and deduplication assessments.

This would not be possible without GoogleScraper, which rocks (https://github.com/NikolaiT/GoogleScraper) and wget. I am merely a meat popsickle scripting monkey.
